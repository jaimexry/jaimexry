-  Hi, I’m @jaimexry, a 21 years old student of Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz, Spain.
-  I’m interested in making videogames or apps as a developer.
-  I’m currently learning a Degree in Software Engineering in UCA (Universidad de Cádiz), Spain and Unity by doing some Online Courses.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on some Company related to videogames, also I´ll upload some personal projects.
-  How to reach me: You can reach me by DM on twitter @jaime_xry! I'll be pleased if I can help in some project.
